        <strong>MySongs</strong>
        is a tiny site with a big heart: a place to explore new tracks, upload
        fresh ones, and craft the coolest playlists to share with your people.
        We believe music pulls friends into the same room, and that's the vibe
        we want to capture: simple, bold, and fun.
      </p>

      <p class="about-body">
        Scroll, sample, save. Build mixes for late drives, study sessions, or
        unhinged dance breaks. MySongs keeps the design minimal and the energy
        high so the focus stays on what matters — the sound.

          We built MySongs as a student project that blends craft and taste.
          Together we handle the tech and the plumbing while driving the
          visuals, animations, and overall vibe. We worked close to learn from
          each other's skills and push for a design that's clean, fast, and a
          little dramatic while keeping really cool features— the way music
          often feels.
        </p>
        <p class="about-copy">
          Our aim is simple: make discovery feel modern and human, then get out
          of the way so the music can do the talking.
